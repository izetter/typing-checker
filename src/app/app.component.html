About the <span *ngFor="let letter of randomText.split(''); let i = index;">({{ letter }}{{ enteredText[i] }})</span> part:

        First, split('') creates a new array in which each element is a charachter of randomText.
    Because this basically is a "for of" loop, letter will be the nth element of this new array of charachters.
        *ngFor creates a <span></span> for every element of the split randomText string, including the
    interpolation syntaxes and parentheses you can see in the "inner HTML" of every <span>.
        The interpolations syntaxes do their job, so in every cycle, {{ letter }} prints the current nth element
    of randomText, and {{ enteredText[i] }} prints the current nth element of enteredText BASED on the index of randomText.
    SO EVERY NEWLY CREATED SPAN ELEMENT HAS AN INDEX based on the amount of characters randomText has i.e.
        let i = index refers to the index of randomText/span elements created by *nfFor. *ngFor is only talking about randomText,
    it NEVER mentions enteredText. This is why when you type something, the first character of enteredText gets placed inside the first
    pair of parentheses/first span element, which contain the first element of randomText... and so on with
    the second and third characters typed etc. 
    Remember that enteredText is bound to an input DOM event!! otherwise this wouldn't work like this!

    You can verify that it's first with first, second with second etcetera by typing a few characters, watch them be pÄºaced
    right next to the randomText characters, then move the cursor to the beginning, type some more and watch the previously
    typed characters switch to the right because their index in enteredText is no longer the same.

    IMPORTANT!
    The previous would make sense only within the context of the "Before coloring" commit, beacuse this was just for demonstration.



    * split('') splits a string between each character beacuse of the empty string argument inside the parentheses denoted
    by the pair of single quotes. But you can split by many other things such as spaces or regex etc.

    ** split() doesn't actually split the original string, it creates a new array based on the split instructions
    and the for of loop works over that new array on the fly. That's why I earlier mentioned something about it creating
    a new array or of this new array of characters, nut later I omitted referring to this newly reated array
    for simplicity reasons. For example, in "prints the current nth element of randomText" it's not actually printing the
    current nth element of randomText, but of this newly created array.
    
    

  Note you can also iterate through a split string in vanilla JS using a
  for/for of loop and the split() method.
